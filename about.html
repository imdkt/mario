           <p> Many fear that the country's healthcare system may not be able to cope with a massive outbreak. 
            Around 130 million people will head to hospitals even if 10% of India's population is infected, according to conservative estimates.
            And the country only has 0.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people, one of the lowest ratios in the world,
            according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
            So, India is pinning its hope of containing the outbreak on social distancing and a complete lockdown of major cities and towns. 
            And the success is down to the efforts of unknown but selfless workers.</p>
